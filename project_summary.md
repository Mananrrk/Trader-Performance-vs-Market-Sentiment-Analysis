## Summary: Trader Performance vs Market Sentiment

### Methodology
The analysis combines daily Bitcoin market sentiment data (Fear vs Greed) with historical trader execution data from the Hyperliquid platform. Trade-level data was cleaned, standardized, and aggregated to a daily granularity to align with the sentiment index. Key performance metrics such as daily PnL, win rate, and PnL volatility (used as a drawdown proxy) were computed. Behavioral indicators including trade frequency, average position size (USD), and long/short bias were analyzed. Traders were further segmented into behavioral groups such as frequent vs infrequent and consistent vs inconsistent based on historical activity and PnL stability.

### Key Insights
1. **Performance differs across sentiment regimes:**  
   Fear days are associated with lower average and median PnL, reduced win rates, and higher PnL volatility, indicating more unstable and emotionally driven trading behavior. Greed days show comparatively higher and more stable performance.

2. **Trader behavior changes with sentiment:**  
   During Fear periods, traders reduce average position sizes and exhibit a short bias, reflecting risk aversion. In contrast, Greed periods are characterized by larger position sizes, higher trading activity, and a long bias.

3. **Certain trader segments are more sensitive to Fear:**  
   Frequent and inconsistent traders experience a sharper decline in performance during Fear regimes, while consistent traders maintain relatively stable outcomes across both sentiment states.

### Strategy Recommendations
1. **Risk-Off Strategy During Fear Regimes:**  
   During Fear days, reduce position size limits and trading frequency, particularly for frequent and inconsistent traders. This helps mitigate drawdowns in high-volatility, low-confidence environments.

2. **Selective Aggression During Greed Regimes:**  
   During Greed days, allow increased position sizes and trading activity only for historically consistent traders. This leverages favorable sentiment conditions while maintaining risk controls for unstable trading profiles.

Overall, the analysis demonstrates that market sentiment has a measurable impact on both trader performance and behavior, and that incorporating sentiment-aware rules can improve risk management and strategy execution.
